## **Project Introduction**
To create a Smart Home Monitor, we will utilize a USB camera as an expansion module.

To control the USB camera using UNIHIKER, we can utilize the OpenCV library. This method allows us to access and control the camera through the board's side interface, which is connected to a microcontroller responsible for managing onboard components and GPIO.

For Camera-based facial detection, we can employ the getAndRenderFace(img) function from the Python OpenCV library. This function enables us to detect faces from the camera feed and display them on the screen of the UNIHIKER board. Feel free to explore the various functionalities and parameters of the OpenCV library to customize your Smart Home Monitoring system.

## **Code**
To implement video streaming and capturing with the Smart Home Monitoring project, we can use the OpenCV library in Python.   

First, import cv2 and use cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) to initialize the camera's function for video output. At the same time, because we are using an onboard buzzer, we need to use the function Board("UNIHIKER").begin() to initialize UNIHIKER. Then, we can use cap.set(), cv2.namedWindow(), and cv2.setWindowProperty() to set the frame rate, window initialization, and window size of the video stream.   

In the main loop, we can use the ret, frame = cap.read() method to initialize the video stream parameters. We set up a callback function getAndRenderFace(img) to accurately recognize faces, which will be called by img = getAndRenderFace(img) in the main loop. Then, we can use if statements to check if a certain key has been pressed. To close the camera, we can use the function cap.release() when the key 'a' is pressed.   

Feel free to experiment with various parameters and functions to personalize your Smart Home Monitoring project.
